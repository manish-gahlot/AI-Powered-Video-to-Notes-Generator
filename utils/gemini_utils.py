        1.  **Translate:** First, identify and translate any Hindi or Hinglish segments into clear, natural English. Keep the timestamps associated with the original segments.
        2.  **Summarize:** Based *only* on the fully English version (original English + translated Hindi), produce structured notes using Markdown formatting. The notes should include the following sections:

            * **## Title**
                * Create a concise, descriptive title for the transcript content (one line).

            * **## Key Takeaways**
                * Provide 2-3 main conclusions or most important points from the discussion.

            * **## Summary Points**
                * List 6-12 bullet points covering the core arguments, key information presented, decisions made, and significant questions raised.
                * Each point should be 1-2 sentences.
                * Include relevant timestamps `[start-end]` where appropriate to reference specific moments in the transcript.

            * **## Key Definitions** (Omit this section if none are found)
                * List any important terms or concepts defined in the transcript, along with their definitions.
                * Include timestamps `[start-end]` for context.

            * **## Action Items / Next Steps** (Omit this section if none are found)
                * List specific tasks, follow-ups, or next steps mentioned.
                * For each item, clearly state the task, who is responsible (if mentioned), and any deadlines mentioned.
                * Include timestamps `[start-end]`.
